1. IP (Internet Protocol)

What it is:
IP is a protocol that defines how devices identify and locate each other on a network and how data packets are delivered.

Main role: Addressing and routing.

Analogy: Think of it like the street address of your house – it tells the postman where to deliver letters.

There are two main versions:

IPv4: 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

IPv6: 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IPv4: 32-bit (≈4 billion addresses)

IPv6: 128-bit (≈340 undecillion addresses)
++++++++++++++++++++++++

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

Size: 32 bits → about 4.3 billion unique addresses.

Format: Four decimal numbers separated by dots (dotted-decimal notation).
Example: 192.168.1.10

Problem: Because of the internet’s growth, IPv4 addresses are running out.

IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

Size: 128 bits → about 340 undecillion unique addresses (enough for every device on Earth many times over).

Format: Eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons.
Example: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 (can be shortened).

Advantages over IPv4:

Much larger address space.

Built-in security features (IPsec).

More efficient routing.

Supports auto-configuration (devices can set their own IPs without DHCP).

2. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

What it is:
TCP is a protocol that ensures reliable communication between devices.

Main role: Makes sure data is delivered completely and in order.

Analogy: Like a phone call – you talk, the other person replies “I heard you,” ensuring nothing is missed.

TCP handles:

Breaking data into packets

Numbering packets

Checking for errors

Resending lost packets

Reassembling packets in the right order

3. TCP/IP

What it is:
TCP/IP is the combination of TCP and IP protocols – the foundation of the Internet.

How it works together:

IP handles addressing and routing (where the data goes).

TCP ensures reliability and correct delivery (how the data arrives).

So:
📦 Data → split by TCP → wrapped with IP address → sent → received → checked and rebuilt by TCP.

4. TCP/IP Addresses

Technically, "TCP/IP address" usually refers to an IP address (the identifier of a device on a network).

For actual communication, you need:

IP Address: The location (e.g., 192.168.1.5)

Port Number (TCP/UDP): The specific service (e.g., port 80 for web, 22 for SSH)

Example: 
  192.168.1.5:80
    192.168.1.5 → IP address (the computer)
    :80 → TCP port (the web server on that computer)
+++++++++++++++++++

✅ Summary:
    IP = Address system (where).
    TCP = Reliable transport (how).
    TCP/IP = The combo that powers the Internet.
    TCP/IP address = Usually just an IP address used with TCP.

you have this:
http://example.com

🔹 Essential Steps
---
1. DNS Resolution (Find the IP address)
Your computer doesn’t know where example.com is.
It asks a DNS server: “What is the IP address of example.com?”
DNS replies:
Example: 93.184.216.34 (IPv4)
Now you have the destination IP address.
---
2. TCP Connection Setup
Your browser needs a reliable connection to the server.
It uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) with the IP address.
The 3-Way Handshake happens:
Your PC → SYN → Server
Server → SYN-ACK → Your PC
Your PC → ACK → Server
✅ Connection established.

🔹 What is the OSI Model?
    - OSI = Open Systems Interconnection
    - It’s a conceptual model created by ISO (International Organization for Standardization).
    - Purpose: To standardize how different systems communicate over a network.
    - It splits communication into 7 layers, each with a specific role.
power of the OSI model:
   -> Standardization   -> التوحيد القياسي
   -> Modularity   -> الوحدات النمطية
   -> Interoperability   -> التشغيل البيني
   -> Layer Independence   -> استقلالية الطبقات
   -> Simplified Troubleshooting   -> تبسيط استكشاف الأخطاء وإصلاحها
   -> Flexibility and Scalability   -> المرونة وقابلية التوسع
   -> Educational Value   -> القيمة التعليمية
   -> Encourages Innovation   -> تشجيع الابتكار
Think of it like a blueprint for how data moves from one computer to another.

🔹 The 7 Layers of the OSI Model (Top → Bottom)
    07 Application  •────── The closest layer to the user; provides application services.
    06 Presentation •────── Encrypts, encodes and compresses usable data.
    05 Session      •────── Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions between end nodes.
    04 Transport    •────── Transmits data using transmission protocols including TCP & UDP.
    03 Network      •────── Assigns global addresses to interfaces and determines the best routes through different networks.
    02 Data link    •────── Assigns local addresses to interfaces, delivers information locally, MAC method.
    01 Physical     •────── Encodes signals, cabling and connectors, physical specifications.

Application Layer in OSI Model:
    - The Application layer enables applications to use the network.
    - is the top layer in this model and takes care of network communication.
    - The application layer provides the functionality to send and receive data from users.
    - It gives applications (like browsers, email clients, Zoom, WhatsApp) a way to request network services without worrying about the lower details.
  Passes Data to Lower Layers
    \- The Application layer doesn’t send raw data directly over the internet.
    \- Instead, it hands its data (like an HTTP request) to the Transport Layer (TCP/UDP).
    \- Example flow when you open www.google.com in your browser:
    \- Browser creates an HTTP GET request (Application Layer).
    \- Passes it to TCP (Transport Layer) → ensures reliable delivery.
    \- TCP hands it to IP (Network Layer) → decides where to send.
    \- IP hands it to Ethernet/Wi-Fi (Data Link & Physical Layers) → sends the bits.





Layer in OSI Model(open system interconnection):
Internet’s architectural model is organized in a stack of protocols composed of 5 distinct layers:
application layer:
    is the top layer in this model and takes care of network communication. The application layer provides the functionality to send and receive data from users.
The transport layer:
The transport layer is responsible for reliable, end-to-end communication between applications running on different hosts. It provides services like segmentation, connection management, error control, and flow control to ensure data is delivered accurately and efficiently.
Network Layer:
Internet’s network layer is responsible for routing packets, which are called “datagrams” in this layer, from one host to another, the sender’s transport-layer protocol gives a segment as well as a destination address to the network layer. The network layer must then deliver this segment to the receiving host’s transport layer.
